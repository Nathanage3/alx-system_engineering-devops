Web Server Basics
Definition:
A web server is a software application or hardware device that stores, processes, and delivers web content to clients over the Internet. It plays a fundamental role in enabling the accessibility of websites and web applications.

Key Components:
1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
The foundation of communication on the World Wide Web.
Facilitates the exchange of information between clients (web browsers) and servers.
2. Server Software:
Examples include Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, and others.
Responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and delivering the appropriate response.
3. Document Root:
The main directory on the server where web content (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) is stored.
Clients access content by requesting specific files within this directory.
4. IP Address and Domain Name:
Servers are identified on the Internet by their IP addresses.
Domain names provide human-readable aliases for IP addresses.
5. Port:
Servers listen on specific ports for incoming connections.
Default HTTP port is 80; HTTPS uses port 443.
6. Protocols:
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) encrypts data during transmission, enhancing security.
SSL/TLS protocols are commonly used for secure communication.
Server-Side Scripting and Databases:
1. Server-Side Scripting:
Dynamic content generation using server-side languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby).
Allows customization of content based on user requests.
2. Databases:
Storage and retrieval of data to support dynamic web applications.
Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
Security Considerations:
1. Firewalls and Security Software:
Protects the server from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
2. Regular Software Updates:
Ensures that the server software and operating system have the latest security patches.
3. Access Controls:
Restricts access to sensitive files and directories.
Uses authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
Scalability:
1. Load Balancing:
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent overload.
2. Caching:
Stores frequently accessed content to reduce server load and improve response times.
Monitoring and Logging:
1. Log Files:
Record information about server activity, errors, and user interactions.
Essential for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
2. Monitoring Tools:
Keep track of server health, resource usage, and potential issues.
Examples include Nagios, New Relic, and Prometheus.
