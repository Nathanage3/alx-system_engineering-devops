Networking Basics
1. Definition of networking:
Networking in the context of computers refers to the practice of connecting computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, peripherals, or other devices to share data and resources.
2. Key Components:

Nodes: Any device connected to a network (computers, printers, servers, etc.).
Router: Directs data packets between networks.
Switch: Connects devices within a single network, managing data flow.
Modem: Connects networks to the internet through various means (DSL, cable, fiber).
3. Types of Networks:

Local Area Network (LAN): Covers a small geographical area like a home, office, or building.
Wide Area Network (WAN): Covers larger geographical areas, potentially worldwide.
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): Spans a city or large campus.
Personal Area Network (PAN): Very small network for personal use, typically within a range of a few meters.
4. Networking Protocols:

Protocols are rules and standards that define how data is transmitted. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
5. IP Addressing:

Devices are assigned an IP address (Internet Protocol address) for identification and location addressing.
6. Network Topologies:

The arrangement of network devices. Common topologies include star, mesh, bus, and ring.
7. Data Transfer Methods:

Wired: Through cables (Ethernet, coaxial, fiber optic).
Wireless: Via radio waves (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
8. Network Security:

Measures to protect data integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Includes firewalls, encryption, and secure passwords.
9. Internet of Things (IoT):

Refers to the growing network of devices connected to the internet, extending networking to everyday objects.
Understanding these basics provides a foundation for delving deeper into the complex and ever-evolving world of computer networks.
